# Microsoft Azure osTicket Setup

This guide is a detailed guide in setting up osTicket on Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines. It's meant to help IT workers, system managers, and anyone looking to set up a strong ticketing system in the cloud. With this guide, I want to share useful tips and recommended methods to make setting up osTicket on Azure easy and effective.

Unfortunately, the documentation isn't available here.

It is located in the wiki section of this repository.
